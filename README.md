# Project Name

Based on the provided code snippets, it appears that your project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built with ASP.NET MVC.
The application seems to manage a list of users, each with properties like Id, Name, and Email. The UserController class in your project handles the web requests related to users. It has methods for displaying the details of a user (Details), creating a new user (Create), and listing all users (Index).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

### Installing

Instructions on how to install the software.

### Running the tests

Instructions on how to run the tests.

### Deployment

Replace <sku_name> with the desired SKU for your App Service Plan (e.g., "S1"), <app_name> with the desired name for your web application, and <azure_region> with the desired Azure region where you want to deploy your application.

1. Wait for the deployment: Azure CLI will create the necessary resources and deploy your application to Azure. Wait for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the progress in the command prompt or terminal.

2. Verify the deployment: Once the deployment is complete, you can verify the deployment by accessing the URL of your web application. The URL will be in the format https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net, where <app_name> is the name of your web application.

By following these steps and using Azure CLI, you can easily deploy your ASP.NET MVC application to Azure. Make sure to provide the appropriate values for the SKU, app name, and Azure region.
